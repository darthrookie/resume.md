I am a Software Engineer with experience in embedded systems, wireless communications, server-side services, operative systems, and computer hardware interfaces. I've worked with multiple chip vendors using a variety of architectures, from which ARM-Cortex M has been the main focus. I've helped get consumer products from design to launch, while mainly being involved in the software side of things I've also helped with hardware design and troubleshooting.
